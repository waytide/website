# Working-state artifacts carry a provenance footer

Every working-state artifact under `waytide/` that is a document with a body ends with a **provenance footer** — the `Authored by … / Changed by …` block, in the record-rule-authorship-in-a-footer format (local, human-readable datetime). This covers **experiments, designs, plans, observations, deferred items, loop records, and work session records**.

- **Same footer, different reason than the rule files.** The rule-file footer exists because `git subtree` strips the composite's per-file history when a package is installed into a consuming project, so `git blame` can't show a rule's author there. That reason does **not** apply to a working-state artifact: it lives in the project's own `waytide/` tree, is never shipped by subtree, and keeps its git history intact. The footer is here for a different reason — **the file should be useful on its own.** These artifacts are written to be read as self-contained documents, so a reader should not have to leave the file and query the git log to learn who wrote it and when.
- **The format is the record-rule-authorship-in-a-footer format.** `Authored by <name> on <local datetime>` for the original author, a `Changed by <name> on <local datetime>` line appended for each later change — oldest first, never rewritten. The datetime is the artifact's true authoring time; for a dated artifact whose ISO-8601-UTC filename prefix records when it was created, that prefix is the authoritative time (a later git add-date from a migration is a false trail).

**The one exception — the decision log.** `waytide/local/log/` entries do **not** carry a footer. A log entry is deliberately one line — a `# <title>`, no body, no template (see the decision-log-convention) — and its authoring time is already in its ISO-8601-UTC filename and its commit. A footer would contradict that shape and the log's no-reformat protection. The log records who and when by its filename and commit history, not by an in-file footer.

**Why:** a working-state artifact is a document meant to be read on its own — a narrative, a design, an experiment record — and its provenance (who wrote it, when, who changed it since) is part of what a reader needs, so it belongs in the file rather than only in version-control history the reader would have to go query. This is a different justification from the rule-file footer's (which recovers history that subtree strips); stating it once, here, keeps every working-state convention from repeating it. The decision log is exempt because its one-line-per-file shape already carries its provenance in the filename, and a footer would break that shape.

**How to apply:** when writing or changing an experiment, design, plan, observation, deferred item, loop record, or work session record, end it with a provenance footer in the record-rule-authorship-in-a-footer format — `Authored by` on creation, an appended `Changed by` line on each later change. Do not add a footer to a `waytide/local/log/` entry. Related: the record-rule-authorship-in-a-footer rule (the footer's format and the rule-file case), the decision-log-convention (the exempt one-line log), and the artifact conventions that reference this one (experiments-convention, design-convention, plans-convention, observations-convention, deferred-convention, work-sessions-convention, and DBE's loop-records).
