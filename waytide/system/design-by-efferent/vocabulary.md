# The Design By Efferent vocabulary: use these terms with these meanings

The lexicon of **Design By Efferent** (DBE) — use this vocabulary, with these meanings, in code, tests, rules, designs, commits, and prose. This is the canonical glossary; the deeper docs defer to it.

## The one-liner

> The AI **generates** straight through, and **gates** at the **hinges** — the **subtle**, **load-bearing** decisions — for the human to **deliberate**; everything else is **mechanical**.

## Terms

| Term | Role | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Design By Efferent** / **DBE** | the methodology | The name of the whole approach these rules, this lexicon, and the loop describe. A **design** discipline (tests drive design, not "development"), driven **by the efferent** — the use-site view. A variant *of* TDD (tests are the vehicle); the name foregrounds what makes it distinct: design originated from the efferent reference. |
| **loop** | the cycle | The DBE cycle — a *distributed* OODA loop (Boyd): the AI **observes** and **acts** (mechanized), the human **orients** and **decides** at the gates. Orientation — design judgment — is the irreplaceable phase, kept with the human. (See "The loop, as a distributed OODA cycle".) |
| **cycle** | the unit of the loop | **One traversal of the loop**: a hinge surfaced, decided, and acted on. It is the unit a loop record is written in — one section per cycle, carrying that cycle's hinge, the options put at the gate, and the decision. See "cycle is scoped by what precedes it". |
| **hinge** | the object | A decision the design turns on — one that is **subtle** *and* **load-bearing**. Where the human's judgment belongs. |
| **attended** / **unattended** | the gating cadence | Whether the loop **stops** at each hinge for the developer (attended, the default) or the agent decides each hinge and generates through (unattended). Chosen at a feature's or experiment's initiation and held for its duration. **DBE is in effect either way** — the cradle, the efferent-first actuation, and the solubility standard hold in both; only the stopping changes. A batch-size trade: attention spent continuously against rework paid at the end. |
| **gate** | the mechanism | Where the loop stops and hands a hinge to the human. The interrupt/handoff. (Verb: the loop *gates* at hinges.) |
| **deliberation** | the human's act | What the human does at a gate: weighs the hinge and decides. *Deliberate* = carefully weighed **and** intentional — the opposite of the AI's averaging. |
| **mechanical** / **mechanics** | the complement | Everything that isn't a hinge — the AI generates it straight through. |
| **subtle** (vs **crude**) | first mark of a hinge | The choice takes design judgment that isn't written in the code or tests — it lives in the person. Crude = a tool/pattern/answer you can read off the artifacts. (Per Bellware's subtle/crude-knowledge distinction: https://madabout.software/articles/subtle-knowledge-crude-knowledge/) |
| **cradle** | the constraint | The efferent test, held during generation — it holds the implementation in position without gripping it rigid, steering toward solubility. |
| **efferent** | the perspective | The use-site view; designing a unit from the outside in (see the `language` vocabulary — the efferent term). DBE is the method built on designing from this view: the test is the first efferent reference, the interface designed from the efferent side. |
| **actuation** | the act | The invocation of the unit under test — the first efferent reference (see the `language` vocabulary — the actuation term). In DBE it is written before any implementation, forcing the interface outside-in, and is the first and highest-leverage gate. |
| **observation** | the act of reading the outcome | What the test observes about the outcome of the actuation. An **assertion** is the mechanism by which an observation is implemented, not the thing itself. |
| **load-bearing** | second mark of a hinge | Other work rests on the choice, so a wrong one spreads and sticks: cheap to fix now, costly later. |
| **solubility** | the quality | The general design-quality term (see the `language` package's solubility rule): how readily a unit dissolves into use. In DBE it is the target of generation and a known hinge — what the efferent view discovers. |
| **mean-bias** | the AI's failure mode | The AI's pull toward the average of the code it has seen — most of which is poorly designed. It acts on the human too: a single AI proposal put up for approval drags the human's judgment down toward that average. |
| **origination** | the human's contribution | The human producing a choice rather than ratifying one. The above-the-average answer is originated, not selected — which is what the gates exist to provoke. |

## The two results the gates rest on

Every gate's form — options plus a mandatory escape — follows from two results, and the rules refer to them by these names:

**Provoke origination, not mean-bias.** A single proposal put up for approval ("here's my actuation — approve?") puts the human in judge mode, downstream of the AI's mean-drawn answer. Judging is not originating: the human ratifies, and their judgment is pulled toward the average rather than exercised above it. Offering several genuine alternatives keeps the human comparing real candidates — originating — instead of ratifying. So a gate presents alternatives, never a fait accompli.

**The best options are ones the AI can't produce.** The option set is the AI's own, drawn from the average. The best answer is often one only the human can produce, and a closed list tempts the human to pick from it instead of producing their own. So every gate keeps an escape open — the human dictating outright, or a chat to work the answer out. The escape is mandatory, at every gate, without exception: it is what keeps the human above the AI's mean when the right answer isn't on the list.

The first result says *why there are options*. The second says *why the options are never enough*.

## "Cycle" is scoped by what precedes it

The word names three nested things, and **the word before it says which**. This is deliberate,
and it is the one place this vocabulary lets a term carry more than one meaning:

- **a cycle** — one traversal of the loop: a hinge surfaced, decided, acted on. The unit a
  loop record is written in.
- **the hinge cycle** — the five hinges in order, actuation through naming, for one outcome's
  initial implementation (see the hinge-cycle rule). A hinge cycle is five cycles.
- **the DBE cycle** — the loop itself, the whole distributed OODA cycle. Interchangeable with
  **the loop**, which is the preferred term for it.

**Bare "cycle" is always the smallest of the three.** The larger two are never written without
their qualifier, so an unqualified cycle is one traversal and nothing else.

**Why one word rather than three.** The three are the same shape at different scales — a
traversal, a sequence of traversals for one outcome, and the whole. Naming them with unrelated
words would hide that they nest; the qualifier carries the scale at the cost of a word. The
alternative considered was to reserve "cycle" for the traversal and rename the other two, which
is more edits for a distinction the qualifier already draws.

## "Load-bearing", explained

The two marks of a hinge — **subtle** and **load-bearing** — are independent, and a hinge needs **both**. "Subtle" is about *who can make the call* (the judgment lives in the person vs. it can be read off the artifacts). "Load-bearing" is about *what depends on the call*.

**The metaphor is literal, not decorative.** In a building, a *load-bearing* wall carries the weight of the structure above it; a *partition* wall just divides a room. You can move a partition wall freely. Move or misplace a load-bearing wall and everything resting on it shifts or collapses — and the later you do it, the more has been built on top, the more it costs.

**Applied to a decision:** a choice is load-bearing when **other work rests on it** — later code, the tests, and other decisions all assume it. So a wrong load-bearing choice has two properties:

- It **spreads** — everything built on it inherits the mistake.
- It **sticks** — once things rest on it, undoing it means undoing them too.

Together these give the **asymmetry that justifies the gate**: a load-bearing choice is **cheap to fix now** (before anything rests on it) and **costly to fix later** (after). The human's judgment has the most leverage *before* the weight is added — which is exactly why the loop gates there and not afterward.

**How to recognize it:** ask *if this choice is wrong, how far does the damage spread, and how expensive is it to reverse once we've built on it?* Wide spread + expensive reversal → load-bearing. Local + cheap to change → not.

**Why both marks are required:**

- Load-bearing **but crude** (the right answer is readable off the code/tests/patterns) → the AI can make it; no gate needed, even though much rests on it.
- Subtle **but not load-bearing** (takes judgment, but the choice is local and cheaply changed) → not worth stopping the human; gating it is ceremony.
- **Subtle *and* load-bearing** → a hinge. Gate it.

**Example:** the **actuation** — the efferent shape of the invocation — is load-bearing: the test, the observations, and the implementation all rest on it, so a wrong shape spreads into all of them and gets costly to change once code depends on it (which is why it is the first and highest-leverage gate). By contrast, the wording of a `comment` line is not load-bearing — nothing rests on it, and it is changed in seconds.

## The loop, as a distributed OODA cycle

"The loop" — the DBE cycle — is a **distributed OODA loop** (John Boyd: **O**bserve, **O**rient, **D**ecide, **A**ct). Boyd's loop is one mind's decision cycle; here the four phases are **split across two agents**, and the split is the whole point.

| OODA phase | Owner | In the loop |
|---|---|---|
| **Observe** | AI | surfaces the state — the proposed actuation, the candidate options, the test, the run result |
| **Orient** | **human** | **deliberates** — weighs the hinge against design judgment (the standard of solubility, subtle knowledge, experience) |
| **Decide** | **human** | chooses at the **gate** — selects an option, dictates, or accepts |
| **Act** | AI | **generates** within the cradle |

**Orient is the load-bearing phase — which is why the human owns it.** Boyd held that Orient dominates the loop: it shapes what you observe, what you decide, and how you act. This method's thesis is identical — the human's **orientation** (design judgment) is the irreplaceable locus, while Observe and Act are mechanized to the AI. The AI's failure mode, "regressing to the average," is a **degraded orientation**: oriented to the mean of all code rather than the well-designed subset. The loop exists to route through the human's orientation at the moments it bears weight — the hinges.

**Implicit guidance = mechanical.** Boyd's loop has a fast path — *implicit guidance and control* — where action flows straight from orientation, bypassing explicit Decide. That is exactly **mechanical** generation: once orientation is settled (the cradle set, solubility clear), the AI generates straight through. The **gate** — an explicit Decide — fires only at a **hinge**.

**What does not transfer.** OODA is best known for its *adversarial, tempo* use — cycle faster than an opponent, get "inside" their loop, collapse their orientation. There is no adversary in DBE; speed-as-weapon does not apply, and importing it would mislead. What transfers is the **structure** — the four phases and the primacy of Orient — not the **contest**.

## Retired terms (do not use)

- **discriminator** → there is no test-noun; the test is just "is this a hinge?"
- **intrinsic** → **subtle**
- **asymmetric** → **load-bearing**
- **capability-independent** → state it plainly (subtlety is about the design, not the model)
- **non-hinge** → **mechanical**
- **pass** (one traversal of the loop) → **cycle**
- **suspending DBE** → **unattended** (the method is never suspended; only the gating is)

**Why:** The terminology is the conveyable output of this work — it is how the approach is taught to other engineers. Scattering it across observations and a digest left no authoritative source and risked drift; one binding glossary keeps usage consistent and avoids the overloaded or academic words this method rejects (e.g. discriminator, intrinsic, "given", "non-hinge"). Each term was chosen for solubility: plain, positive where possible, and free of programming collisions. Two competing "the name" declarations would drift, so DBE is the single canonical name.

**How to apply:** Use these words, with these meanings, wherever you write about DBE. Prefer them over synonyms; do not reintroduce a retired term. Related: the DBE-as-design-tool, first-turn, human-in-the-loop, hinge-cycle, and "TDD designs, coverage protects" rules; the `language` package's solubility rule and its name-literally standard.
